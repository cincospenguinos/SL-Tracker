# SL-Tracker
An app for the Pebble Smartwatch that keeps track of your workouts when following the Stronglifts 5x5 program. This app keeps track of the weight of your squats, bench presses, bent rows, overhead presses and deadlifts. The app logs all of your workouts for reference later. Just install and run and you have the entire app at your disposal.

## NOTE

The version of SL-Tracker shown in the repository is old. It contains a lot of code and things I didn't like, and ultimately I decided to abandon. The most updated version of this project is located [here](https://github.com/cincospenguinos/SLTracker)

### Disclaimer

I am not associated with Stronglifts, Mehdi, or anyone from their team. I do not represent them and I am not affiliated with them in any way. I'm just a geeky fan of their routine and wanted to create something for Pebble users. This project sprung solely from that desire.
